# [Challenge 04 - React Native Concepts](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafios/tree/master/desafio-conceitos-react-native)

In this challenge you have to create an application to train what you've learned so for with React Native!

Now you must keep developing the application that will store your repositories, in which you already developed the backend with NodeJS at the last challenge.

## Installing
1. Clone the application

```
git clone git@github.com:cleiver/GoStack11-Desafio04-conceitos-react-native.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

## Running the application

You have to be running the [backend application](https://github.com/cleiver/GoStack11-Desafio02-conceitos-nodejs) in order for this to work. You also have to have an Android or iOS emulator or a way to run it in your device.

```
yarn start
```

And at another tab:

```
yarn android
```

or

```
yarn ios
```

## Running the tests

```
yarn test
```
